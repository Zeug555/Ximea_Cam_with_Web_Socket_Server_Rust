## High-level bindings for xiAPI

### Status
This library is still work in progress and should not be used in production yet. 
Some features and parameters from xiAPI are not yet implemented.
For access to features that are not implemented yet, please consider the generated bindings in the [xiapi-sys](https://crates.io/crates/xiapi-sys) package.

### Supported versions and cameras
These bindings have been tested with xiAPI version 4.25 on Windows and Linux. Newer version will likely also work, but
some new features may be unsupported. All cameras that are supported by xiAPI are also supported by these bindings.

### Requirements
To use these bindings, the XIMEA software package must be installed in the default path
(For Windows: C:\XIMEA; For Linux: /opt/XIMEA).
To install the XIMEA software package, please follow the [instructions on the XIMEA website](https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/APIs#Software-packages).

### Documentation
Specific documentation for this package is still WIP.
For general documentation on xiAPI please have a look at the [API manual](https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/XiAPI_Manual).
